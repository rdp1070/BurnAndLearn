#PokeMath Overview
A game designed for the XO to teach fourth graders math concepts. Based on the turn-based battle game Pokemon, this game challenges the player's math skills in three main areas: Geometry, Multiplication, and Percentages. Each of these question types is characterized by a monster. A monster asks question of a specific level that corresponds to the player's own level. 
All monsters begin at level 1, asking the easiest questions. When the player answers the question correctly, the monster loses health (determined by the player's attack stat). 
If the player answers the question incorrectly, the monster attacks and the player loses health. A monster keeps asking questions until its health goes below 0 from the player answering questions correctly. When the monster dies, the player gains experience. If the player's experience reaches a multiple of 10, the player gains a level. The player continues through the game, encountering new monsters at increasing levels, until they die or reach level 4.
